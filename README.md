# CD-Final-project-GroupF

When we talk about humanities, literature and literary theories are always the first to be mentioned as an important carrier of humanistic ideas. And in the current period of rapid development of the Internet, what topics are generally being studied in academic journals about literature? In order to explore this question, we decided to conduct a textual analysis of academic journals on literature for the whole year just past 2023. Due to the more stringent copyright restrictions on journals, we chose to download open-source journals based on the Scopus database. Also, since English is the most widely spoken language and has the largest number of journal articles written in English, we chose to limit the language used in the journals to English in order to find a more generalised answer.

Therefore, in this final project, we focus on journal articles within the scope of Literature and Literary theory from the Scopus database. There is our research question: Analyze the trends and preferences in topic selection of English literature journals on Scopus in the year 2023.

## 1.Introduction and Background

Our final group project looks into the preferences and trends in journal topic selection, specifically targeting English-language literary journal articles in the Literature category on Scopus for the year 2023. We downloaded all the open-source English-language literary journal articles from the official Scopus website and scraped the articles into txt documents. This document cleaning provides accurate and convenient text data for further subsequent data processing and analysis.
To help viewers better understand and learn the whole process of our project, our final group project is divided into three parts: 1:introduction and backgroundï¼›2:tutorials, 3:active learning exercises.
